# Micrograd Implementation - Making my own neural network package

The point of this repo is to help me understand better how neural networks work under the hood. 

I thought it was a better use of my time rather that just scrolling through Instagram.

All credits go the Andrej Karpathy for providing the guidance to building whatever is there in this repo.
